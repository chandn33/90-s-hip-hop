        <h3>A Lil' bit about Hip-Hop</h3>
        <p>Hip-Hop originally began in the 1970s in New York City (the Bronx).
It is most popular for it's unique culture, dance and fashion. 
However, 90's Hip-Hop took over making it the popular era of music;
it revolutionised the genre and had a huge impact on the music industry inspiring 
many to rap. Rappers like The Notorious B.I.G began freestyling and attended
rap battles which made him famous. Despite his death, his incredible talent and
unique flow continue to be celebrated today. His music, along with other influential
artists like Tupac and Nate Dogg have left a lasting impact on the 90's era and beyond.
They are still appreciated by fans all over the world.

        <h3 class="text-center">West vs East</h3>
            <p>In the 90's the rivalry between East Coast and West Coast involved
                a fued between Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., two prominent
                rappers. They both initially started out as friends supporting one another
                with their music. However, their friendship evetually turned into a bitter
                rivalry and sadly they both had a tragic death in separate incidents
                making the peak of the East Coast-West Coast feud. Having said that,
                other rappers like Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep and Jay-Z also played a part 
                but Tupac and Biggie became the most prominent figures in the rivarly.
